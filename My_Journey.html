	<p> 
		My name is Nicole Cai and I am currently 14 years old. I started playing 
	    the sport table tennis at age 8. Currently, I have played the sport for 
		6 years and have enjoyed it ever since. My mom was my very first coach; 
		big inspiration. I want to apply for the equipment scholarship because I 
		want to improve my game and my techniques. I believe that a racket that 
		suits my style of playing will benefit my game play extremely. I had never 
		thought that I was capable of being on the national team. Once achieving 
		this goal, my next short-term goal is to be selected on the junior 18 girl
		team, but my ultimate goal is to continue to play Ping-Pong and strive to be 
		on the World Championships Squad. Another goal of mine is to compete not only 
		in Canada but also World Wide. This can provide the experience that can help 
		me as an individual. I train 3 or 4 times per week with professional players 
		in Toronto. Each professional lesson, I train for 2 to 3 hours and a total of 
		6-8 hours a week. My style is that I loop for my forehand and chop in my backhand. 
		Right now, my blade is from "Stiga", all wooden. As in today, I use smooth rubber 
		for my forehand (Red Side) and long pipes for my backhand (Black Side).  For my 
		smooth rubber, the thickness is 2.2mm and hardness is 39 and for my black long pipes 
		is use the thickness 1.0mm. </p>
